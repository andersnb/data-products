Introduction

- Do you know how much money you need for retirement?

- How much have you saved?

- How long will your retirement last?

Average Retirement Stats
==============================
Here are some stats related to the questions on the previous slide:

- You need to save approximately 25 times your expected annual income from those savings in retirement (assuming interest rates stay the same).

- The average American has saved $60,000 a year, which would provide an annual income of only $2400!

- The average retirement lasts more than 25 years. Your money has to last that long too!

The Super-Duper Retirement Calculator
=====================================
The Super-Duper Retirement Calculator does the calculation for you!  You enter in your desired annual income from your savings and the calculator estimates the amount of money you need to save. 

Here's an example. Suppose you enter 50000. The calculator will return:


```r
50000. * 25.
```

```
[1] 1250000
```

Conclusion
========================================================
In summary, the Super-Duper Retirement Calculator does the heavy lifting of estimating how much money you need to save for retirement.

Enjoy and good luck with your savings plan!
